Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting
Overview
=
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock data and forecasting future prices for key companies: AAPL, MSFT,IBM,TSLA and GOOG. The main objectives are to visualize stock performance, analyze statistical properties, and forecast future stock prices using a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model. Additionally, an algorithmic trading strategy based on momentum was implemented for AAPLMMSFT,IBM,TSLA and GOOG.

Project Structure
=

data_collection.py: Script to download and preprocess historical stock data.
visualization.py: Scripts for various visualizations, including stock price trends and forecasted prices.
analysis.py: Script to perform statistical analysis, including stationarity tests and differencing.
forecasting.py: Script to build and fit the VAR model and forecast future stock prices.
trading_strategy.py: Script to implement a momentum-based trading strategy for AAPL.
README.md: This document.

Data Collection & Preparation 
=

The  historical stock data for AAPL, MSFT, NFLX, and GOOG downloaded  Directly from the api so there is no need to downloade seperate data .

Visualization
=

Stock Price Trends: Line plots of historical and forecasted closing prices.
Algorithmic Trading: Scatter plot highlighting buy and sell signals based on momentum.

Statistical Analysis
=

ADF Test: Performed Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check for stationarity.
Differencing: Applied differencing to make the time series data stationary.

Forecasting
=

VAR Model: Built and fitted a Vector Autoregression model to forecast future stock prices.

Algorithmic Trading
=

Implemented a momentum-based trading strategy for AAPL stock, identifying buy and sell signals.

Results
=

Forecasted Prices
